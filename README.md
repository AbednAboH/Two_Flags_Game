Two Flags Game:

Using ai concepts and algorithm we created a Chess game with only bishops that uses ai algorithms to detirmine its next move.

This project uses a tcp/ip connection to a server and sends the moves to a local server to allow an apponent to play against the ai and also allows a human player to play against the ai with no server needed meaning on the same GUI
